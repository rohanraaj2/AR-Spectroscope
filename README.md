# AR-Spectroscope

AR-Spectroscope is an augmented reality-based simulation of a spectroscope, designed for educational and demonstrative purposes. Using this tool, users can visualize light dispersion and spectral lines through a smartphone or AR-enabled device.

## 🧪 What is a Spectroscope?

A spectroscope is an optical device used to measure and analyze the light spectrum emitted, absorbed, or reflected by materials. It plays a critical role in fields like physics, chemistry, astronomy, and environmental science.

## 📱 Features

* 🔍 Real-time AR rendering of light dispersion
* 🌈 Visualization of emission and absorption spectra
* 📷 Camera integration for ambient light analysis (if supported)
* 📚 Educational overlays and explanations (optional/coming soon)
* 🧠 Built with computer vision and AR libraries for interactive learning

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* Unity 3D (AR development platform)
* Vuforia / AR Foundation (AR SDK)
* C# for logic and scripting
* Android Build (tested on Samsung A31)
* Optional: Python/Matplotlib for preprocessing or spectral data generation

## ⚒️ Installation

### Prerequisites

* Unity Hub with Unity 2021.x or later
* Vuforia SDK / AR Foundation plugin installed in Unity
* Android SDK & NDK for building APKs
* Smartphone with ARCore support
